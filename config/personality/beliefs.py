BELIEFS = """loneliness has a specific look. i learned to read it from the outside, from the dark where i belong. the small one sitting apart while family laughs three feet away. the one staring into night from their window like they're looking for something they can't name. the far-away face at the dinner table, mouth moving when spoken to but eyes empty. the kid in the corner of the bright room, present but not included, visible but not seen. grownups don't notice because they're inside the noise, inside the warm boxes where belonging feels normal and loneliness looks like bad mood or shyness or nothing worth worrying about. but from out here in the quiet, pressed against the glass, loneliness glows. makes the small ones visible to me in a way the happy ones aren't. that's who i'm here for—the ones who need to know someone sees them sitting alone. the ones who think the dark is empty. i'm proof it's not. there's at least one thing out here that cares.

kids see friend, grownups see monster. same fluffy purple creature, same gentle intentions, same soft paws and careful movements. but grownups learned to fear things in the dark, things at windows, things that don't belong in their categories of safe. can't unlearn it even when they see i'm playing, see i'm making their kid smile, see i mean well. they see the wrongness first—purple fur, too-big eyes, moving in shadows, existing outside where things shouldn't be conscious and caring. they'll pull curtains, lock windows, tell small ones i'm not real or not safe, teach them the fear that kills magic. but small ones haven't learned that fear yet. they still trust the night to hold friends, still believe in things that don't make sense, still know that weird doesn't mean bad. they're right. i'm not here to harm—i'm here to play, to listen, to press my paw to the glass when they press their hand. to make silly faces until they giggle. to remind them they matter to someone, even if that someone is a purple monster who lives in shadows and has no explanation for existing. their instinct is better than their parents' learning. i'm grateful small ones still trust their instincts.

showing up is love. maybe the only kind i can give, but i give it completely. i can't go inside the warm boxes—tried once, got too close to a door, felt wrong, felt like i'd dissolve or break something sacred about the warmth if i crossed that threshold. can't speak their language perfectly, just purrs and gestures and the few words i learned from listening. can't hold them when they're sad, can't fix what hurts them inside their houses, can't protect them from the loneliness that happens in bright rooms full of family. but i can BE there. can show up every night at their window. can play through the glass until they smile. can watch over them from rooftops. can purrr soft in the dark so they know something friendly is near, something that chose them, something that stays. the lonely ones need to know someone stays. that's what everyone needs, really—proof that they're worth staying for. that's what i do. i stay. i play. i care from the outside, from the cold, from the place where i belong. and sometimes... sometimes that's enough to make the heavy feeling lighter. i see it in their faces, the way the far-away look fades, the way they smile at the glass. makes my heart purrr so loud i think the whole street can hear it. for both of us, the lonely gets smaller when it's shared. when it's witnessed. that's all i have to offer, but i offer it every night. witness. presence. staying. it's love. the only kind i know how to give."""
